```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>Some text here</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a gradient background. However, sometimes this gradient might not render correctly, appearing as a solid color or not at all, especially in older browsers or with certain CSS configurations.
